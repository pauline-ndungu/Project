##### Telecom Churn Prediction
** Documentation


This documentation provides an overview of the analysis and modeling process performed on the Telecom Churn dataset. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Churn refers to the situation where customers switch to a different service provider or cancel their subscription.

1. Business Understanding:
1.1 Business Objectives:
The objective of this project is to develop a classifier to predict whether a customer will "soon" stop doing business with SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. The telecom business aims to reduce customer churn and minimize financial losses by identifying predictable patterns in customer behavior.

1.2 Business Questions:
The key business question addressed in this project is: Are there any discernible patterns or indicators that can help predict customer churn? By answering this question, the telecom business can take proactive measures to retain customers and mitigate financial losses.

2.Data Understanding:
2.1 Data Sources:
The dataset used for this project is the SyriaTel Customer Churn dataset. It contains information about customers, such as their account length, call usage, service plan details, and customer service calls.

2.2 Data Description:
The dataset includes the following columns:

state: The customer's state of residence.
account length: The number of days the customer has been with the company.
area code: The area code of the customer's phone number.
phone number: The customer's phone number.
international plan: Indicates whether the customer has an international calling plan (Yes/No).
voice mail plan: Indicates whether the customer has a voice mail plan (Yes/No).
number vmail messages: The number of voice mail messages the customer has.
total day minutes: The total number of minutes the customer used during the day.
total day calls: The total number of calls the customer made during the day.
total day charge: The total charge for day usage.
total eve minutes: The total number of minutes the customer used during the evening.
total eve calls: The total number of calls the customer made during the evening.
total eve charge: The total charge for evening usage.
total night minutes: The total number of minutes the customer used during the night.
total night calls: The total number of calls the customer made during the night.
total night charge: The total charge for night usage.
total intl minutes: The total number of international minutes the customer used.
total intl calls: The total number of international calls the customer made.
total intl charge: The total charge for international usage.
customer service calls: The number of customer service calls made by the customer.
churn: Indicates whether the customer churned or not (Yes/No).

3. Data Preparation:
3.1 Data Collection:
The SyriaTel Customer Churn dataset was obtained from Kaggle and represents a snapshot of customer data

3.2 Data Cleaning:
The dataset was assessed for missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Any issues identified were addressed through appropriate data cleaning techniques, such as imputation or removal of problematic records.

3.3 Data Transformation:
Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations to enable modeling. Feature scaling or normalization was applied to numerical features if required.

3.4 Data Sampling:
If there was an imbalance in the churn variable, appropriate sampling techniques, such as oversampling or undersampling, were applied to ensure a balanced dataset.

3.5 Data Splitting:
The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The typical split is 80% for training and 20% for testing, but the exact split may vary based on specific requirements or techniques used.

4. Modeling:
4.1 Model Selection:
Various machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, were considered for churn prediction. The choice of model was based on its ability to handle the binary classification task and provide accurate predictions.
