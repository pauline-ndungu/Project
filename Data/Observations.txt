Positive Correlation:

Values close to 1 indicate a strong positive correlation.
Values close to 0.5 or above indicate a moderate positive correlation.
Values close to 0 indicate a weak or no correlation.

Negative Correlation:
Values close to -1 indicate a strong negative correlation.
Values close to -0.5 or below indicate a moderate negative correlation.
Values close to 0 indicate a weak or no correlation.

Numerical columns:

It has a weak positive correlation with 'total day minutes' (0.000778) and 'total day charge' (0.000776).
It has a weak negative correlation with 'total day calls' (-0.009548).
Total Day Minutes:

It has a weak positive correlation with 'account length' (0.006216) and 'total day charge' (1.000000).
It has a weak negative correlation with 'number vmail messages' (0.000778).
Total Day Calls:

It has a moderate positive correlation with 'total day minutes' (0.006750) and 'total day charge' (0.006753).
It has a weak negative correlation with 'number vmail messages' (-0.009548).
Total Day Charge:

It has a weak positive correlation with 'account length' (0.006214) and 'total day minutes' (1.000000).
It has a weak negative correlation with 'number vmail messages' (0.000776).

These correlation coefficients indicate that there is no strong linear relationship between any pair of variables in the provided subset.
The correlations are generally weak, suggesting that these variables are not strongly dependent on each other.
It's important to note that correlation measures only linear relationships, and there might be other types of relationships or dependencies between the variables that are not captured by correlation alone.

Numerical feature distribution:

Account Length: The distribution of account lengths appears to be relatively uniform, indicating that customers have varying durations of account tenure.

Number of Voicemail Messages: The majority of customers have a low number of voicemail messages, with a peak at zero. This suggests that a significant portion of customers does not utilize the voicemail feature.

Total Day Minutes: The distribution of total day minutes is approximately normal, with a slight right skew. Most customers have a range of 150 to 250 minutes of usage during the day, with a peak around 200 minutes.

Total Day Calls: The distribution of total day calls shows a roughly symmetric pattern with a peak around 100 calls. This suggests that the majority of customers make a similar number of calls during the day, without any significant outliers.

Total Day Charge: The distribution of total day charges closely follows the shape of the total day minutes distribution since the charge is directly proportional to the minutes. It is approximately normal with a slight right skew, reflecting the distribution of usage charges incurred during the day.

Account Length:

The distribution appears to be relatively uniform, with no prominent peaks or valleys.
The data is evenly spread across the range of values.
Number of Voicemail Messages:

The distribution is skewed to the right, indicating that a majority of customers have a low number of voicemail messages.
There is a peak at zero, suggesting that a significant portion of customers does not use voicemail.
Total Day Minutes:

The distribution is approximately normal, with a slight right skew.
The majority of customers have total day minutes in the range of 150 to 250, with a peak around 200 minutes.
Total Day Calls:

The distribution is roughly symmetric and shows a peak around 100 calls.
The data is relatively evenly spread across the range of values, with no significant outliers.
Total Day Charge:

The distribution closely follows the shape of the Total Day Minutes distribution since the charge is directly proportional to the minutes.
It is approximately normal with a slight right skew.
Total Eve Minutes:

The distribution is similar to the Total Day Minutes distribution, with a peak around 200 minutes.
It is slightly skewed to the right.
Total Eve Calls:

The distribution is approximately symmetric, with a peak around 100 calls.
The data is relatively evenly spread across the range of values.
Total Eve Charge:

The distribution closely follows the shape of the Total Eve Minutes distribution since the charge is directly proportional to the minutes.
It is approximately normal with a slight right skew.
Total Night Minutes:

The distribution is approximately normal, with a peak around 200 minutes.
It is slightly skewed to the right.
Total Night Calls:

The distribution is approximately symmetric, with a peak around 100 calls.
The data is relatively evenly spread across the range of values.
Total Night Charge:

The distribution closely follows the shape of the Total Night Minutes distribution since the charge is directly proportional to the minutes.
It is approximately normal with a slight right skew.
Total Intl Minutes:

The distribution is right-skewed, indicating that a majority of customers have a lower number of international minutes.
There is a peak around 10 minutes, suggesting that many customers have international calls of shorter duration.
Total Intl Calls:

The distribution is approximately symmetric, with a peak around 3-4 calls.
The data is relatively evenly spread across the range of values.
Total Intl Charge:

The distribution closely follows the shape of the Total Intl Minutes distribution since the charge is directly proportional to the minutes.
It is right-skewed, similar to the Total Intl Minutes distribution.
Customer Service Calls:

The distribution is right-skewed, indicating that most customers make a small number of customer service calls.
There is a peak at zero, suggesting that a significant portion of customers does not make any customer service calls.
